Dear Arthur,

It is our pleasure to gift you this money with love, and with the wish for you to relaxed  and be liberated to enjoy your college experience to its fullest, and to apply yourself to your studies without the hindrance of anxiety. I wish you to be free from that painful hindrance now and all your life. It is almost always not necessary. You are on a great track and are performing so well, to realize all your dreams.

Much love,
Grant and Linda
