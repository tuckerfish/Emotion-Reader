Hello Tim,

I heard about the recent ordeal. Frankly even before I became critical of your resentful tone I've been perplexed by your deplorable actions towards this company. My patience is limited and you have left it reduced. You may think I'm unjustified, but you have proven far worse. Your employment has been blacklisted. 



Best,
Alex Scharch
